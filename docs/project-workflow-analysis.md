# Project Workflow Analysis

**Date:** 2025-10-06
**Project:** E2E Gift
**Analyst:** Jea

## Assessment Results

### Project Classification

- **Project Type:** Web application
- **Project Level:** Level 3 (Full product)
- **Instruction Set:** instructions-lg.md

### Scope Summary

- **Brief Description:** E2E Physical Gift Management System - Hệ thống tự động hóa quy trình quản lý quà tặng vật lý từ kho Agency đến tay người tiêu dùng, bao gồm 6 workflows chính: Gift Planning, Delivery to Agency WHs, Delivery to Stores, Gift Usage, Gift Recall, và Stock Management. Tích hợp với UHub platform hiện có và UGMS (Unilever Gift Management System).
- **Estimated Stories:** 12-40 stories
- **Estimated Epics:** 2-5 epics
- **Timeline:** Dec 2025

### Context

- **Greenfield/Brownfield:** Brownfield - Adding to existing UHub codebase (operational since 05/2020)
- **Existing Documentation:**
  - UHub History document (`/UHub/2025Aug-Lich-Su-Uhub.md`)
  - Detailed process flows (`/UHub/puml/2_quy_trinh_chi_tiet.puml`)
  - Archived PRD (`/archives/prd.md`)
  - Technical architecture documentation
- **Team Size:** 3 members (1 Frontend, 1 Backend, 1 QA)
- **Deployment Intent:** Azure production environment (aligned with existing UHub infrastructure)

## Recommended Workflow Path

### Primary Outputs

1. **Full Product Requirements Document (PRD)** - Comprehensive PRD for Level 3 project
2. **Epic Breakdown** - Detailed epic planning with story mapping
3. **Architecture Handoff Package** - Technical specifications for architect review
4. **Integration Specifications** - UGMS API integration requirements
5. **PowerBI Dashboard Requirements** - Reporting and analytics specifications

### Workflow Sequence

1. **Project Assessment** ✅ COMPLETED
2. **Load Level 3 Instructions** (instructions-lg.md) → NEXT
3. **Generate PRD Sections:**
   - Goals and Background Context
   - Requirements (Functional & Non-Functional)
   - User Interface Design Goals
   - Technical Assumptions
   - Epic List with detailed stories
4. **Architect Handoff:** Prepare technical specifications for 3-solutioning workflow
5. **Validation:** Review against PRD checklist

### Next Actions

1. Load `instructions-lg.md` for Level 3-4 project guidance
2. Load `prd-template.md` to structure comprehensive PRD
3. Generate PRD sections progressively with user approval checkpoints
4. Prepare for Epic breakdown and story mapping
5. Route to architecture workflow (`/bmad/bmm/workflows/3-solutioning/`)

## Special Considerations

### Integration Complexity
- **UGMS Integration:** Critical dependency requiring RSA 2048-bit authentication, bi-directional sync, and real-time data consistency
- **UHub Platform Extension:** Must maintain compatibility with existing Angular/.NET Core stack
- **PowerBI Integration:** Requires 3x daily refresh cadence for operational dashboards

### Workflow Complexity
- **6 Major Business Workflows:** Each workflow (B1-B6) has multiple actors and approval gates
- **Multi-level Approval System:** Level 1 and Level 2 approval workflows with ticket management
- **Multi-role System:** Agency, Sales, PG, BU Team, Utop Admin - each with distinct interfaces and permissions

### Timeline Constraints
- **Target: Dec 2025** - Aggressive timeline for Level 3 scope with 3-person team
- **Dependencies:** UHub platform upgrade planned for Q4 2025/Early 2026
- **Recommendation:** Focus on MVP features, defer advanced analytics to Phase 2

### Technical Debt Awareness
- Working with existing UHub codebase (5+ years old)
- Need to assess current architecture patterns before extending
- Integration points may require refactoring for E2E system

## Technical Preferences Captured

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** Angular with TypeScript (existing UHub stack)
- **Backend:** .NET Core with Azure MS SQL Server
- **Cloud Infrastructure:** Azure App Service, Azure Service Bus, Azure CDN
- **Mobile:** Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities for field teams

### Integration & Security
- **UGMS API:** RSA 2048-bit digital signature authentication
- **User Sessions:** OAuth 2.0 with JWT tokens
- **Data Encryption:** AES-256 at rest and in transit
- **Event Architecture:** Event-driven for inventory updates and reconciliation

### Deployment & Operations
- **Environment:** Azure production (aligned with UHub)
- **Monitoring:** Health check endpoints and system status dashboards
- **Compliance:** Standard enterprise compliance (detailed requirements TBD)
